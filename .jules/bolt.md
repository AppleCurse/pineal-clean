## 2024-05-24 - Async HTTP Connection Pooling
**Learning:** Instantiating `httpx.AsyncClient` inside a loop or within parallel `asyncio.gather` tasks prevents connection pooling and increases overhead for concurrent requests to the same host.
**Action:** When performing parallel async HTTP requests, instantiate a shared `httpx.AsyncClient` outside the `asyncio.gather` block and pass it to the worker functions.
